Conversion remarks
==================

- token layer is the normalized text
- manuallly deleted "norm" from exmaralda (original in "exb_orig")
- one text seems missing (there should be two Aremisia texts)
- file names are weird, like "<something>_tokenized.exb" -> file names become document names, so you should name them more carefully
