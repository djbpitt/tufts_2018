Conversion remarks
==================

- diplomatic text is token, "norm" is an annotation span on the token with the attribute value "norm" and the actual normalized text
- one text seems missing (there should be two Aremisia texts)
- file names are weird, like "<something>_tokenized.exb" -> file names become document names, so you should name them more carefully
