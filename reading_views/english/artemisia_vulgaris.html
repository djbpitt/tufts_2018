      <h1>English: artemisia_vulgaris</h1>
      
      <ol>
         
         <li class="p6">It is a shrub- like herb similar to wormwood [3-26] but bigger, and with the leaves
            coarser.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p7 p9">There is one sort that is prosperous with broader leaves and stems, another smaller,
            the flowers little, thin and white, with a strong smell; it flowers in the summer.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p10">Some ( in the Mediterranean parts) call a slender- branched little herb with a single
            stalk, extremely small, abundant with flowers of a tawny yellow colour, Artemisia
            monoclonos.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p11">The scent of this is sweeter than of the other.</li>
         
         <li class="p12">They both warm and relieve.</li>
         
         <li class="p13 p14 p15">Boiled, they are good put into womens' baths for driving out the menstrual flow and
            afterbirth, as an abortifacient, for the closure and inflammation of the womb, the
            breaking of stones [ urinary, kidney], and stoppage of urine.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p16 p17 p18">Much of the herb applied to the lower part of the bowels induces the menstrual flow,
            and the juice ( kneaded together with myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and applied) draws
            from the womb as many things as does bathing; three teaspoonfuls of the filaments
            is given in drink to bring out the same things.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p19">If anyone has the herb artemisia with him while travelling it dissolves weariness,
            and if you wear it on your feet it drives away venomous beasts and devils.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p20">After blood has hardened around the joints, take the bigger branches with rosaceum
            [1-53] and ( having boiled them in a pot) rub the sick man all over with this as [
            PAGE 513] he goes to sleep.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p21">It helps womens' womb congestion considerably, and soothes slow painful urination
            and rupture of the opisthotonum [ form of tetanus].
         </li>
         
         <li class="p5">It is also called toxetesia, ephesia , anactorios, sozusa, lea, or lycophrys; the
            Magi call it sanguis hominis, it is also called chrysan themon, the Romans call it
            salentia, some, serpyllum, others, herba regia , rapium , tertanageta, or artenisia
            , the Gauls call it ponem, and the Dacians, zuoste.
         </li>
