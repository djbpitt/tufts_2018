         <li class="p6 p7 p8">The flowers and bruised leaves of this give off the smell of sampsuchum [3-47], Therefore
            if anyone is suffering in his stomach he should pound this herb well with oil of almonds,
            and make ( as it were) a warm compress and lay it on the stomach, and he shall be
            healed.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p9 p10 p11">If anyone is pained in his strength, having mixed the juice of this with oil of roses
            let him rub with it, and he shall be whole.
