         <li>A mbrosia is a little shrub three feet in height, full of branches, with small leaves like rue around the emergent stalk.</li>
         <li>It has small stems full of little seeds like little bunches of grapes, which never flower â€” smelling pleasant like wine.</li>
         <li>The root is slender, two feet long.</li>
         <li>In Cappadocia it is plaited into wreaths for the head.</li>
         <li>It is able to repress and repel, and is smeared on as an astringent for fluids that have come down.</li>
