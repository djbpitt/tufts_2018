         <li>Botrus is a yellowish herb like a shrub, broad- spread, having many wings, and the seed grows around all the branches.</li>
         <li>The many leaves are similar to chicory, and all of it has a wonderful sweet scent, and so it is also laid among cloths.</li>
         <li>It grows especially near running waters and brooks.</li>
         <li>A decoction ( with wine) is used as a drink to ease difficult breathing.</li>
         <li>The Cappadocians call this ambrosia, and it is also called artemisa.</li>
