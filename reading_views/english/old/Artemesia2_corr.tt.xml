      <ol>
         <li>Artemisia grows around rivulets and hedges and in sown fields.</li>
         <li>The flowers and bruised leaves of this give off the smell of sampsuchum [3-47], Therefore if anyone is suffering in his stomach he should pound this herb well with oil of almonds, and make ( as it were) a warm compress and lay it on the stomach, and he shall be healed.</li>
         <li>If anyone is pained in his strength, having mixed the juice of this with oil of roses let him rub with it, and he shall be whole.</li>
      </ol>
