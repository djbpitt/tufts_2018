         <li class="p3 p4">A mbrosia is a little shrub three feet in height, full of branches, with small leaves
            like rue around the emergent stalk.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p5 p6">It has small stems full of little seeds like little bunches of grapes, which never
            flower â€” smelling pleasant like wine.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p7">The root is slender, two feet long.</li>
         
         <li class="p8">In Cappadocia it is plaited into wreaths for the head.</li>
         
         <li class="p9">It is able to repress and repel, and is smeared on as an astringent for fluids that
            have come down.
         </li>
         
         <li class="p10">It is also called botrys, or botrys artemisi a, the Romans call it caper sylvaticus,
            or apium rusticum, and the Egyptians, merseo.
